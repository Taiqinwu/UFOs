# UFOs
* Create a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings around the world using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Overview of Project:
* Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
* Create a filter on the Webpage that takes UFO sightings on multiple criteria

## Results:
* Website Link: https://taiqinwu.github.io/

Here is a full view of the website

In this table you can enter multiple criteria to filter out the UFO sightings.

Here is an example:
* I filtered the date 1/10/2010, state to CA, and country to US

## Summary: 
* One drawback with this table is that you need to type in the criteria in specific format (following the examples shown). If you type in 1-10-2010, then the filter doesn't work. If you accidently put a space in front of CA, then it won't work. So, the user have to becare their spacing, and follow the format. 
* Two improve to make this table better is to accepting all format, and add a clear all filter button.
